# Keep the answers and predictions, but ignore the large input data if desired, strict size limits? 
# Usually test data is fine, but ignoring binary/large files is good. 
# actually the guidelines say "submit code", usually data is ignored but for this specific assignment 
# usually instructions say don't upload the data if it's huge, but 7MB is fine.
# We will keep it simple.
